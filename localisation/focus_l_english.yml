 NZL_cool_storage_desc:0 "We are a farming nation with 30 million sheep and 2 million dairy cows, and in times of war shipping may be in short supply.

Although considered inferior to a new-built Bren, it was available, lighter and worked perfectly and reliably during testing."
 NZL_truck_assembly_plant:0 "Truck Assembly Plants"

 NZL_armor_effort2:0 "Domestic Designs"
 NZL_armor_effort2_desc:0 "With foreign sales cut off, a number of citizens have proposed basic light tank designs we can construct ourselves.

 # Singapore
 NZL_singapore_focus:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_singapore_focus_desc:0 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_singapore_forts:0 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_singapore_forts_desc:0 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_naval_effort:0 "Develop Shipbuilding"
 NZL_naval_effort_desc:0 "Our country has an established, if modest, shipbuilding industry.

 NZL_destroyer_effort2:0 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_destroyer_effort2_desc:0 "Our waters need defenders. We can start planning for the construction of smaller craft on our own initiative. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."
 NZL_navy_doctrine2:0 "Form the RNZN"
 NZL_navy_doctrine2_desc:0 "As the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, due to expansion our forces are largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. Identifying our navy as our own recognises this fact. Historically this occurred 1 October 1941."

 # Island Defence
 NZL_fiji_focus:0 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_fiji_focus_desc:0 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."

 NZL_political_effort:0 "Look Beyond the Commonwealth"
 NZL_political_effort_desc:0 "New powers are arising in the Pacific, and Britain is occupied ever-more distantly in Europe. While our ties to Britain may remain, our country's needs may require us to look at other options as well.
