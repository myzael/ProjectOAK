Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance Armored Car -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower.

The Sdkfz.231 had 15 mm of slightly sloped front armour. Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."

 PRC_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 PRC_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 PRC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 PRC_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 PRC_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 PRC_submarine_4:0 "Han Class"
 PRC_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 PRC_destroyer_1:0 "Type 30 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 PRC_destroyer_2:0 "Type 39 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 PRC_destroyer_3:0 "Type 42 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 PRC_destroyer_4:0 "Type 52 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 PRC_light_cruiser_1:0 "Type 28C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 PRC_light_cruiser_2:0 "Type 35C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 PRC_light_cruiser_3:0 "Type 44C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 PRC_light_cruiser_4:0 "Type 50C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Type 30HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Type 38HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Type 43HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Type 58HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 PRC_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Type 40BC Class"
 PRC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 PRC_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Type 51BC Class"
 PRC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 PRC_battleship_1:0 "Zhou  Class"
 PRC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 PRC_battleship_2:0 "Chen Class"
 PRC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 PRC_battleship_3:0 "Zhu De Class"
 PRC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 PRC_battleship_4:0 "Mao Class"
 PRC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 PRC_SH_battleship_1:0 "Type 50SHBB Project"
 PRC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 PRC_SH_battleship_2:0 "Type 59SHBB Project"
 PRC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 PRC_carrier_1:0 "Yulin Class"
 PRC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 PRC_carrier_2:0 "Shanghai Class"
 PRC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 PRC_carrier_3:0 "Beijing Class"
 PRC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 PRC_carrier_4:0 "Liaoning Class"
 PRC_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

 JAP_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "The Type 38 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed as an advancement on the Type 30 after the Russo-Japanese War. It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the Japanese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 99 Rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle developed during the war to replace the outclassed Type 38. The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

It was developed after experiences from the war in China and was made in preparation for the Blitzkreig in the East. It fired the same cartridges as the type 99, but it's performance and reliability was considerably improved.

 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Type 100/44 Submachine Gun was an improved version of the Type 100 which featured a considerably higher firing rate of 800 rpm, and much better reliability due to less complicated design. The barrel was slightly longer, and the bayonet mounting bar / bipod were eliminated. Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Type 4 Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Type 4 Rifle was a Japanese response to semi-automatic rifle development in other countries. Rather than designing one from scratch, they elected to copy the M1 Garand, which they were coming into frequent contact with on the Pacfic Theater. The Type 4 was a reversed engineered copy of the M1 Garand, which had an internal magazine as opposed to an en-bloc clip. The rifle was supposed to begin mass production in 1945, but only 100 of a 250-gun order were completed before the war ended."

With the Ausf M chassis, the engine was located near the middle of the vehicle, and the armament was placed at the rear in a specially designed armoured section. The superstructure could fold down to allow 360-degree traverse at low elevation. Including the single prototype, 141 Flakpanzer 38(t)s were built from November 1943 to February 1944, entering service in 1944."

A total of 434 were built; of these, the Germans seized 244 when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired 52 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service, it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942."

After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army. Production ended in 1942, when its main armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyers and its derivative vehicles. It was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks during the outset of WWII. The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most Light Tank designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs."

Multi-turreted, heavy and slow, they were not considered successful therefore only five were made. These were primarily used for propaganda purposes, though three took part in the Battle of Norway in 1940. It had a main turret housing a 75mm Kwk L/24 and a 37mm KwK L/45 and two secondary turrets from Pz-1 at the front and rear. It was powered by a Maybach HL 108 TR 12-cylinder gasoline engine with 250 HP which gave it a road top speed of 25 km/h. It was very thinly armoured with 20mm and had a weight of 23.4 tons."

 GER_heavy_tank_equipment_1942_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a heavy tank developed in 1942 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Soviet armor encountered in the initial months of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. The 88mm KwK36 L/56 was chosen for the Tiger. It was surprisingly agile with its weight of 57 tons (Ausf.E) and its engine Maybach HL230 P45 V-12 700 HP allowing for a sustained road top speed of 40 km/h . The Tiger I had frontal hull and turret armour of 100 mm and a 120 mm thick gun mantlet. Side hade 80 mm armour on the side superstructure/sponsons, while turret sides and rear were 80 mm. Armour plates were mostly flat, with interlocking construction. The armour joints were of high quality, being stepped and welded rather than riveted and all armour plates were made of surface layer hardened steel."

Since Porsches Tiger Prototype was rejected, the chassis was chosen for conversion to a TD inspired by the Nashorn. In comparison, the regular Tiger was equipped with the “short” version of the 88mm, the KwK 36 L/56. Performance was such that the maximal effective range in direct fire was estimated to be 4500 to 5000 m. This was way beyond anything the Red Army possessed at the time. With this gun and an impressive frontal armor of 200mm this TD would theoretically be an excellent tank killer - and had a great kill rate - but its mechanical unreliability was troublesome and more Elefants were abandoned and destroyed by its own crew because of breakdowns than actually killed by the enemy. The weight was 70 tons and it was powered by a complicated array of 2 x Maybach HL120 which in turn powered an electric Siemens-Schuckert 500 VA generator which in turn powered electric motors. It managed a top road speed of 30 km/h."

This system is almost drag free but would have been very vulnerable to damage. However with the production version He-100 D-1 the cooling was redesigned to a conventional system and additional air cooled radiators were installed.

One particularly acute problem arose with the lack of an alloy with a melting point high enough to endure the high temperatures involved, the service life of an engine was therefore 20-50 hours. The aircraft made its first successful flight entirely on jet power on 18 July 1942, powered by a pair of Jumo 004 engines. With its top speed of 900 km/h and heavy armament of 4 x 30mm MK108 cannons it was best suited as a bomber destroyer, since its agility was not suited for dogfights. 24 x 55mm R4M Rockets could be carried and the Sturmvogel could carry up to 2 x 500kg bombs."

The Condor Legion proved that ground-attack aircraft were a very effective weapon and dive bombers alone could not fulfill that role. This led to a request of Luftwaffe for a specialized aircraft. It was anticipated that the damage to such an aircraft would come from small arms fire from the ground necessitating an armoured ´bathtub´ and 75mm armour glass canopy. Attacks were low-level strafing runs, so the cockpit was close to the nose to maximize visibility. The A version was unsatisfactory and the B version was chosen as production version. The engine had to be second rate, e.g. 2 Gnome-Rhône 14M engines with 700 HP each power at take off and it managed a maximum speed of 407 km/h. Basic armament was a 30 mm MK 101 cannon with armor-piercing ammunition, two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons and two 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns or in place of the 30mm gun-pod four 50 kg bombs under the centreline."

Such designs were not well established at the time, and the 24-cylinder DB 606 "power system" - actually a twin DB601 engine, combined with the cooling and maintenance problems caused by the tight nacelles housing the system, caused a tendency for catching fire in flight: due to these issues it got the nickname Reichsfeuerzeug ("Reich's lighter") or "Flaming Coffin". It eventually matured into a usable design when the engine troubles were adressed by version A3/R2 and the DB610 ´power systems´(2 x DB605 engines) with a combined power of 2900 HP each. Its maximum speed was then 565 km/h and its bomb load 7000 kg. The defensive armament was 7 guns ranging from 7,92mm up to 20mm."

The Ar 68 entered Luftwaffe service in 1936. Soon, the fighter was sent to fight in the Spanish Civil War, where it was outclassed by the Soviet Polikarpov I-16. Arado responded by upgrading the engine of the Ar 68E to the Jumo 210Da with 670 HP allowing a maximum speed of 335 km/h.

Although the low-wing monoplane offered by Nakajima was more advanced, the Army preferred the more maneuverable biplane offered by Kawasaki. In order to overcome the speed disadvantage the Kawasaki team used a metal three-blade propeller in the third prototype, while flush-head rivets were used in an attempt to reduce drag. The structure was of all-metal construction, which was then fabric-covered. Armament consisted of two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propeller. The initial production version was powered by a liquid-cooled 633 kW (850 hp) Kawasaki Ha9-IIa V-12. About 300 of the initial production version were made from December 1935 to October 1937, and another 280 of a second variant, the Ki-10-II, were built from June 1937 to December 1938."

Great losses not only in guns, but also in artillery tractors and heavy vehicles, as well as the growing need of the front, forced the specialists of the State Automobile Inspection of the Red Army to create a new concept of regimental and division artillery for self-propelled gun carriages. This project was rather a forced measure, as a little earlier "gunners" were deprived of self-propelled guns, which were handed over to the tank units. The project was named OSA (obshchevoyskovaya samokhodnaya artilleriya). It was not the predecessor or development from family SU-76, but represents a new class of artillery systems, intended for use in structure of infantry formations."

This particular tank started development in 1938 as an attempt to replace the T-26, T-40, the failed T-46 project and the T-50. Whilst such a large number were produced, it was hated by all who had to deal with it – all except the Germans, who found it to be a substandard and underwhelming opponent, and a rather nice ammunition carrier or gun towing tractor, once captured. \n In 1942, the T-60’s frontal armor was increased to 35 mm (1.37 in), which was still inadequate and made the tank more sluggish. \n Finally, any attempt to increase the caliber of the gun proved difficult. There were attempts to replace the main gun with a 37 mm (1.45 in) ZiS-19 or a 45 mm (1.77 in) ZiS-19BM, but proved unsuccessful as a result of the small turret. T-60 as a whole was canceled with the introduction of the T-70 in late 1942."

These tanks were horrendous owing to their poor maneuverability, weak guns, and inferior armor. The T-70 was an attempt by N.A. Astrov to counter these three problems. Whilst the gun was generally better suited to the reality of tank-on-tank warfare, it still had poor mobility and underwhelming protection. The tank’s legacy passed on into the somewhat well-known SU-76 self-propelled gun, which was also a less than desirable tank. \n The T-70 was armed with a 45-mm L/46 gun Model 38 with forty-five rounds carried, and a coaxial 7.62-mm DT machine gun."

SU-76M used lengthened T-70 chassis. A ZiS-3sh was placed at the rear, protected by an enclosed 10-35 mm thick sloped armored casemate. Power was provided by two GAZ-202 engines parallel to one another, each engine driving one track. The driver was placed between them, to the front, but had trouble operating them without good training. The gun had a coaxial DT machine-gun and the crew of three also carried personal firearms. \n Until 1945 factories would deliver no less than 13,932 vehicles."

It used the chassis of the T-44 Med.TK and was intended to replace the SU-100 which itself had only entered service with the Red Army in late 1944. Two prototypes of the Uralmash-1 with different armament were built in early 1945, one with the 100 mm D-10 tank gun, the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank gun. While mass production was initially recommended, the end of the war with Germany in May 1945 eventually caused the project to be cancelled due to lack of necessity. If the Uralmash-1 had entered service, the 100 mm variant would have been designated SU-101 (СУ-101) while the 122 mm variant would have been designated SU-102 (СУ-102)."

The tank weighed 7.4 tons, and had a one-man turret fitted with a 37mm gun and two 7.7mm machine guns. The suspension system was relatively poor and did not perform excellently on rough ground, but it had fantastic mobility otherwise, and was a very effective tank in situations with less roads available. It was one of the best early war Light Tanks, if not the best. About 2,300 units were produced from 1936 to 1943."

The gun was of a higher velocity than the Chi-Ha's 57mm gun, and performed much better in combat. The Type 97 Kai had frontal armor of 25mm, side of 26mm, and rear of 20mm. It had a max speed of 38 kph. 930 were built from 1942 to 1943, and an additional 300 Type 97 Chi-Ha were retrofitted with the newer 47mm tank gun."

The Type 1 Chi-He was equipped with a 47mm tank gun, which had improved piercing over the low-velocity 57mm gun. It had an additional 70 hp on its engine, which compensated for improved frontal armor. It was also the first Japanese tank to carry radio as standard equipment. 170 were built from 1943 to 1944."

The Type 3 was designed from May to October 1943, but was not put into production until 1944, owing to the low priority of Japanese tanks. It had a 75mm gun, 50mm of frontal sloped armor, and a 240 hp engine that enabled a top speed of 39 kph. 166 were built from 1944 to 1945."

It was a 30-ton, all-welded armor tank with a maximum armor thickness of 75mm. Its main armament was a turret mounted 75mm gun, and also had two heavy machine guns for close defense. Its 400 hp engine was considerably better than the Type 3 Chi-Nu's, giving it a top speed of 45 kph. While it was intended to produce 25 tanks per month, due to resource shortages only 6 chassis and 2 completed tanks were ever built in 1944."

Based on information gained from fighting on the Eastern Front, the Army requested a new tank which weighed 35 tons, had 75mm armor, and a 75mm gun. The IJA also wanted a tank which could consistently inflict high loss rates on the American M4 Sherman. This project became the Type 5 Chi-Ri. While the tank was quite advanced, only one unfinished prototype was ever made due to the war ending."

The mortar had a 3 kilometer range and a 170 kg projectile. The gun was extremely heavy and could not be elevated more than 50 degrees due to balance of the vehicle. The design was well-received but it would have been expensive to produce, and so attention instead went to self-propelled multiple rocket launchers instead. 4 units were built in 1944, but none were used in combat."

It was developed by using the Type 97 Chi-Ha engine and chassis, and replacing the 57mm tank gun with a 75mm artillery piece. This gun was mounted in an open casemate, with only frontal and side armor. Due to its open design and lack of machine guns, it was quite vulnerable in close combat. 26 were built in 1942, before it was superceded by the Ho-Ni II and III."

The Type 3 Ho-Ni III, on the other hand, used an improved 75mm gun, had a fully enclosed superstructure, and up to 25mm of welded armor. It had a top speed of around 38 kph. An order of 57 was placed with Hitachi in 1944, but production was hampered by material shortages and only 41 of the order were built by the end of the war."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_1_short:0 "Lanchester 6x4"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_1_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_2_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_3_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_5_short:0 "AEC Mk II"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_5_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor.

The AEC remained valuable for years to come."
