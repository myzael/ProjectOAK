Armour was 11mm and main armament was the 20mm KwK35 L/45 ( later some used captured T-26 turrets) and the vehicle tipped the scale at over 12 tons.

Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance Armored Car -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower.

The Sdkfz.231 had 15 mm of slightly sloped front armour. Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."

 PRC_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 PRC_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 PRC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 PRC_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 PRC_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 PRC_submarine_4:0 "Han Class"
 PRC_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 PRC_destroyer_1:0 "Type 30 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 PRC_destroyer_2:0 "Type 39 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 PRC_destroyer_3:0 "Type 42 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 PRC_destroyer_4:0 "Type 52 Class"
 PRC_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 PRC_light_cruiser_1:0 "Type 28C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 PRC_light_cruiser_2:0 "Type 35C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 PRC_light_cruiser_3:0 "Type 44C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 PRC_light_cruiser_4:0 "Type 50C Class"
 PRC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Type 30HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Type 38HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Type 43HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Type 58HC Class"
 PRC_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 PRC_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Type 40BC Class"
 PRC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 PRC_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Type 51BC Class"
 PRC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 PRC_battleship_1:0 "Zhou  Class"
 PRC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 PRC_battleship_2:0 "Chen Class"
 PRC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 PRC_battleship_3:0 "Zhu De Class"
 PRC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 PRC_battleship_4:0 "Mao Class"
 PRC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 PRC_SH_battleship_1:0 "Type 50SHBB Project"
 PRC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 PRC_SH_battleship_2:0 "Type 59SHBB Project"
 PRC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 PRC_carrier_1:0 "Yulin Class"
 PRC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 PRC_carrier_2:0 "Shanghai Class"
 PRC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 PRC_carrier_3:0 "Beijing Class"
 PRC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 PRC_carrier_4:0 "Liaoning Class"
 PRC_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the Japanese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."

Rather than designing one from scratch, they elected to copy the M1 Garand, which they were coming into frequent contact with on the Pacfic Theater. The Type 4 was a reversed engineered copy of the M1 Garand, which had an internal magazine as opposed to an en-bloc clip. The rifle was supposed to begin mass production in 1945, but only 100 of a 250-gun order were completed before the war ended."

Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were developed, it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II, during the Polish and French campaigns. The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions beginning with the invasion of France. It was used in both North Africa against the British and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. A/B/C were very similar and had a weight of 8.9 tons, maximal armour of 15mm, a crew of 3 and a top speed of 40 km/h. Ausf.C became the main production model from 1938 on. "

Only the turret was the same as the Ausf. C model, with a new hull and superstructure design with 30mm glacis armour and the use of a Maybach HL62TRM engine driving a seven-gear transmission (plus reverse). The design was shorter (4.65 m) but wider (2.3 m) and taller (2.06 m) than the Ausf. C. The Ausf. E differed from the Ausf. D only by having lubricated tracks. It used the same 20mm/L55 cannon as the A/B/C and had a crew of 3. Many of the earlier Pz-II versions were uparmored. Although it reached a top speed of 55 km/h it had less performance cross country than the predecessors  because of the torsion-bars. "

The hull was redesigned with a flat 35 mm plate on its front, and the armor of the superstructure and turret were built up to 30 mm on the front with 15 mm to the sides and rear. There was some minor alteration of the turret, suspension and a new commander's cupola as well. It used the 20mm Kwk 38. Weight was increased to 9.5 tonnes. From March 1941 to December 1942, 524 were built; this was the final major tank version of the Panzer II series."

The design was well-received but it would have been expensive to produce, and so attention instead went to self-propelled multiple rocket launchers instead. 4 units were built in 1944, but none were used in combat."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_1_short:0 "Lanchester 6x4"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_1_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_2_short:0 "Morris CS9"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_2_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_3_short:0 "Daimler Mk II"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_3_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_4_short:0 "Humber Mk IV"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_4_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy armoured car. The definitive production Mk IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus Humbers were sold to nations all over the world."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_5_short:0 "AEC Mk II"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_5_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on long patrols. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."
